I've been into the "hobby" (more or less) of mechanical keyboards for a little more than a year. After throwing myself into cold water by buying a Pok3r as my first board, I've since got accustomed to the 60% form factor. 60% meaning using basically just the alphanumeric "block" and moving the F-keys and the number pad to function-layers accessible via different key-combinations and different keyboard layers.

## Parts
After having some soldering experience in the past and building my first DIY-keyboard, the [S-60X](https://sentraq.com/collections/kits/products/s60-x-diy-keyboard-kit), I've finally made my decisions on what parts to use for my first truly custom board:
 * **Case**: I originally planned to use this beautiful [aluminum high profile case from Sentraq with brass weight](https://sentraq.com/collections/group-buys/products/sentraq-60-high-profile-aluminum-case) but after countless delays of the Group Buy I decided to temporarily use this [acrylic case from mechboards UK](https://mechboards.co.uk/shop/all/60-diffused-acrylic-case/) until my case arrives.
 * **Plate**: [Brass plate from mechanisk](https://mekanisk.co/).
 * **Switches**: I've loved [Zealios](https://zealpc.net/collections/switches/products/zealio) ever since modding my Pok3r with the 65g version. This board will have the 67g variant.
 * **Switch tops**: Stumbled upon these [dyed switch tops from KBDfans](https://kbdfans.cn/collections/keyboard-part/products/gateron-rainbow-dyeing-top-house-10pcs) and decided to use them.
 * **Stabilizers**: [Transparent screw-ins from Zealpc](https://zealpc.net/collections/switches/products/zealstabilizers).
 * **PCB**: The [b.faceX2 from Winkeyless](http://winkeyless.kr/product/b-face-x2-pcb/). I wanted one that came with pre-soldered underglow and support for my desired layout which includes a split backspace and split right shift.
 * **Keycaps**: I stripped my [Originative GMK Skeletor](https://originative.co/products/skeletor) set from my S-60X because I wanted to go with the whole purple/golden theme. It was the only set I had that kind of matched my theme and supported my layout.
 * **Miscellaneous**:  
   [Lube](https://zealpc.net/collections/switches/products/ghlube) for switches and stabilizers,  
   Cable: currently undecided whether to even get a new one,  
   Cotton wool from Q-Tips to lessen the rattling sound from the stabilizers,  
   Sound dampening inlay inside the case cut out of a thick old [Roccat mouse mat](https://www.roccat.org/en-DE/Products/Gaming-Mousepads/Taito-Series/Taito/).

#### Discarded Ideas:
 * __Sentraq PCB__   
   _pro:_ used it before, has underglow, easy to cofigure and flash(website configurator)  
   _con:_ seems unreliable, people that were in the Massdrop GB of the S-60X have reported that their underglow LEDs stopped working after some time(happend to mine, too)
 * __GH60 Satan PCB__  
   _pro:_ easy to source, popular(meaning more community-support in case something goes wrong)  
   _con:_ no underglow
 * __Banana Split PCB__  
   _pro:_ has a split space bar in a 60%, which is also compatible with a lot of key sets  
   _con:_ different screw location, requires a special case, missed the GB
 * __Zeal60 PCB__  
   _pro:_ per-switch LED  
   _con:_ expensive, no underglowm wasn't available when I decided which PCB to use
 * __In-switch LEDs (with hotswap-sockets)__ I may add the LEDs later but without being sure whether sockets will fit or not, I've, as of now, decided against them.
 * __Holtites__ They seem to be compatible with the b.face PCB but I'm not planning on replacing the switches anytime soon. I also don't know how tight they fit the switches and because I may travel with the board, I didn't want to risk them being loose and the switches falling out.

### The Build

### Lessons Learned
 1. Group Buy delays are unpredictable.
 2. Shipping from China to Germany can faster than shipping from the UK to Germany

### Conclusion
This can get pretty expensive really fast. Not including the shipping costs and customs fees this beauty ended up costing me around 500â‚¬. Was is worth it? Sure. And many other people seem to think so, too. If this sparked your interest check out the wonderful communities around r/mk, Geekhack and Deskthority.
