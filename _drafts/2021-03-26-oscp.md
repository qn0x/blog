# Introduction
Hello there, it's been a while.  

A lot has happened in during the time this blog was inactive. Besides getting certified as a [Cyber Security Professional](https://www.t-systems.com/de/en/careers/entry-areas/security/cyber-security-professional-program), I also passed the [Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) exam! In this post I want to reflect on my experience of the course and share what it took for me to pass. I also want draw a rough timeline of important milestones that paved the way to my final exam date.
