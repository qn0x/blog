After reading about the practicality of traveling with only a fairly small backpack I decided to try it myself.  
The trip was for my work/study program which requires me to travel to another city about once a month via train/public transport. During the trip I stay at a hotel (food not included) and attend university classes for most of the day. I am at the beginning of the third of the 3-year program so I already had a pretty solid packing list that just needed some small tweaks.  
For this trip I used the Borealis 28L backpack from The North Face instead of my usual suitcase/backpack combo.

### What I Packed
#### Clothing
 * 4x T-Shirt
 * 3x Underpants
 * 2x Bra
 * 3x Socks
 * 2x Shirt
 * 1x Leggins (if it gets cold, I could wear them underneath my pants)
 * 1x Chinos
 * 1x Shorts (for sleeping)
 * 1x Shoes (Vans)
 * 1x Hoodie (wore it on traveling days)
 * 1x Jacket (wind and water proof)
 * 1x Shemagh
 * 1x Beanie

#### Toiletries
Everything I use daily that fit in the 1L zippable bag with a few extras: hand sanitizer and Asprin

#### Electronics
 * Laptop
 * Laptop power supply
 * Powerbank (5,000mAh)
 * Phone cable (USB-C)
 * Kindle
 * Kindle/Powerbank cable (Micro USB)
 * Small wireless mouse
 * small rollable mouse pad
 * In-ear headphones

#### Everything Else
 * 1x Big Nordkamm Packing Cube
 * 1x Medium Eagle Creek Packing Cube
 * 1x Nondescript 1L bag for toiletries
 * 1x Microfiber towel + pulverized detergent (for washing clothes)
 * 2x A5 Notebook + Pens
 * 1x Tote bag for groceries and/or going out
 * 1x Plastic bowl with plastic spoon and fork (eating cereal in the morning)
 * 1x Knife (for cake-cutting purposes)
 * 2x Medium-sized plastic bags (just in case I need them)
 * Small purse for coins and minimal wallet/card holder
 
 ### Lessons Learned
 * Bring another pair of pants.
 * Instead of a bulky hoodie, rather bring an extra shirt.
 * Very practical when traveling by train or any kind of public transport with many changes.
 * I have a bulky but powerful laptop with a heavy power supply. If it isn't needed bringing my Surface would've reduced the weight of the backpack significantly.
 * Bringing the tote bag was a good idea. It saved me the hassle to repack the backpack during the week.
 * Clothes should be washed every day instead of every two days. Colder weather means that clothes take longer to dry (duh.) and space for hanging clothes in a hotel room can be pretty scarce.
 * If there's any space left, bring an extra pair of shoes, especially if it rains a lot.
